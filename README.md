### 🚀 About Me

- 🔥 I'm a passionate **developer** crafting both **frontend magic** and **backend logic** — with a pinch of DevOps for deployment sorcery.
- 💡 Always exploring new tech, building side projects, and automating the boring stuff.
- 🔁 Obsessed with reusable components, UI kits, and dev tools.
- 🎯 I mostly write code, break stuff, fix it again, and repeat until it works!

### 🎧 When Not Coding...

- Vibing to music (code and synthwave are best friends 🎶)
- Browsing cool UIs for fun
- Probably still coding tbh... it's the hobby too 😅
